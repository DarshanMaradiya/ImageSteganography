# ImageSteganography

This was my Mini Project-I at Nirma University.
I had my friend Panah Mavani as my partner in this.
He has done the major work.

Brief on Repository:
In `MATLAB` folder, there is `main.m` file which is the main project file.
In `C` folder, there is basic demo code written in C language which demonstrates the process performed on only one 8*8 block of the image. This was implemented after learning the theory behind DCT(Discrete Cosine Transformation)
